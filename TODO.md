# TODO Checklist

This comprehensive checklist identifies actionable items to improve the plugin architecture framework across all core areas: Plugins, Apps, Tools, Libs, Docs, and CLAUDE.md.

## Plugins

### Architecture & Performance

- [ ] **Reduce plugin manifest coupling in product-plugin**
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:7, plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:91-98`
  - **Rationale:** Hard dependency on user-plugin creates tight coupling and makes product-plugin non-reusable in other contexts
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Abstract user authentication through a configurable interface rather than depending directly on user-plugin. Consider using plugin context services for user validation.

- [ ] **Implement proper error handling in plugin controllers**
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:112, plugins/user-plugin/src/lib/controllers/user-plugin.controller.ts:66`
  - **Rationale:** Delete operations don't return proper error responses; missing try-catch blocks in several methods
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add comprehensive try-catch error handling and return meaningful error responses with proper HTTP status codes.

- [ ] **Optimize plugin guard dependencies resolution**
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:35, plugins/user-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:44`
  - **Rationale:** Complex guard dependency chains may cause circular dependencies and slow plugin loading
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement guard dependency graph analysis and optimize loading order. Consider using guard composition patterns.

### Business Logic

- [ ] **Complete cross-plugin service implementations**
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/user-plugin/src/lib/controllers/user-plugin.controller.ts:110-122, plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:166-172`
  - **Rationale:** Cross-plugin integration endpoints are incomplete stubs without actual cross-plugin communication
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement proper cross-plugin service communication using the CrossPluginServiceManager with proper service tokens.

- [ ] **Add plugin lifecycle hook implementations**
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:24-53, plugins/user-plugin/src/lib/controllers/user-plugin.controller.ts`
  - **Rationale:** User plugin lacks lifecycle hooks while product plugin has them; inconsistent plugin behavior management
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Standardize lifecycle hooks across all plugins and implement proper cleanup in beforeUnload hooks.

## Apps

### Plugin Host Performance

- [ ] **Optimize plugin loader memory usage**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-loader.service.ts:100`
  - **Rationale:** Large plugin loader service with 35K+ lines may cause memory issues; potential memory leaks in plugin tracking
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement plugin loader service chunking, use WeakMap for plugin references, and add memory cleanup intervals.

- [ ] **Implement plugin dependency resolver timeout handling**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-dependency-resolver.ts:309-336`
  - **Rationale:** Current timeout implementation may leave hanging promises and doesn't handle partial dependency resolution

  - **Suggested Fix:** Add graceful timeout handling with partial dependency resolution and proper promise cleanup mechanisms.

- [ ] **Add circuit breaker pattern for plugin calls**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-circuit-breaker-config.service.ts`
  - **Rationale:** Missing circuit breaker implementation for failing plugins could cascade failures across the system
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement circuit breaker pattern with configurable failure thresholds and automatic recovery mechanisms.

### Plugin Registry Optimization

- [ ] **Optimize database query performance in registry service**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-registry/src/app/services/plugin-registry.service.ts:306-312`
  - **Rationale:** Plugin listing and search operations may perform inefficient database queries without proper indexing
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add database indexing for plugin searches, implement query result caching, and use database connection pooling.

- [ ] **Implement batch plugin operations**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-registry/src/app/services/plugin-registry.service.ts:58-304`
  - **Rationale:** Registry only supports single plugin operations; bulk operations would improve performance for large plugin sets
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add batch upload, validate, and delete operations with transaction support and progress tracking.

- [ ] **Add plugin registry metrics and monitoring**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-registry/src/app/services/plugin-registry.service.ts:375-377`
  - **Rationale:** Limited metrics collection for registry operations; missing performance and usage analytics
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement comprehensive metrics collection for upload/download rates, validation performance, and storage utilization.

### Business Architecture Gaps

- [ ] **Implement plugin rollback mechanism in host**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-loader.service.ts`
  - **Rationale:** No rollback capability when plugin updates fail; could leave system in inconsistent state
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add plugin version rollback with state snapshots and dependency rollback cascading.

- [ ] **Add plugin conflict detection and resolution**
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/cross-plugin-service-manager.ts`
  - **Rationale:** Multiple plugins may export services with same tokens causing conflicts
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement plugin conflict detection with automatic resolution strategies and namespace isolation.

## Tools

### Developer Experience

- [ ] **Improve plugin generator CLI argument validation**
  - **File/Module Path:** `tools/plugin/src/generators/plugin.ts:5-10`
  - **Rationale:** Generator accepts any plugin name without validation; could create invalid plugin projects
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add plugin name validation using the isValidPluginName utility and provide helpful error messages with suggestions.

- [ ] **Add progress feedback to plugin build executor**
  - **File/Module Path:** `tools/plugin/src/executors/plugin-build.ts:28-52`
  - **Rationale:** Build process provides limited feedback during long compilation steps; poor developer experience
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add progress bars, step-by-step feedback, and estimated completion times for build operations.

- [ ] **Implement plugin dependency analysis tool**
  - **File/Module Path:** `tools/plugin/src/executors/plugin-validate.ts`
  - **Rationale:** No tool to analyze plugin dependencies and detect potential conflicts before deployment
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Create dependency analysis executor that validates plugin compatibility and suggests optimal loading order.

### Automation Opportunities

- [ ] **Add automated plugin testing executor**
  - **File/Module Path:** `tools/plugin/executors.json`
  - **Rationale:** No automated testing executor for plugins; manual testing is error-prone and time-consuming
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Create plugin-test executor that runs unit tests, integration tests, and plugin-specific validation in isolated environments.

- [ ] **Implement plugin performance benchmarking tool**
  - **File/Module Path:** `tools/plugin/src/executors/`
  - **Rationale:** No automated performance testing for plugins; performance regressions can go unnoticed
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add benchmark executor that measures plugin loading time, memory usage, and API response times with historical comparison.

## Libs

### Code Quality & Reusability

- [ ] **Remove duplicate validation logic between plugin-types and shared/utils**
  - **File/Module Path:** `libs/plugin-types/src/lib/plugin-interfaces.ts:19-25, libs/shared/utils/src/lib/string-utils.ts:86-88`
  - **Rationale:** Plugin name validation is duplicated in multiple places; violates DRY principle
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Consolidate validation logic in shared/utils and export from plugin-types to maintain single source of truth.

- [ ] **Optimize plugin context service dependency injection**
  - **File/Module Path:** `libs/plugin-context/src/lib/plugin-context.service.ts`
  - **Rationale:** Heavy dependency injection in plugin context may impact plugin startup performance
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement lazy loading for context services and use factory patterns for optional dependencies.

- [ ] **Add comprehensive type guards for plugin types**
  - **File/Module Path:** `libs/plugin-types/src/lib/plugin-interfaces.ts:18-37`
  - **Rationale:** Some branded types lack runtime type guards; could lead to runtime type errors
