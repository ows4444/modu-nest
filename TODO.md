# TODO Checklist

Based on comprehensive code architecture review focusing on Plugins, Apps, Tools, Libs, Docs, and CLAUDE.md.

## Plugins

- [ ] **Refactor plugin context injection in `plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/services/product-plugin.service.ts:19`**
  - **Rationale:** Manual context injection via `setPluginContext()` creates tight coupling and inconsistent initialization patterns
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Use constructor-based dependency injection with `@Inject('PLUGIN_CONTEXT_SERVICE')` decorator

- [ ] **Remove hardcoded sample data in `plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/services/product-plugin.service.ts:154-189`**
  - **Rationale:** Hardcoded data prevents proper testing and creates inconsistent plugin behavior across environments
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Move to external configuration file or environment-based initialization

- [ ] **Optimize plugin loading strategy in `plugins/user-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:8`**
  - **Rationale:** `loadOrder: 100` for user-plugin vs `loadOrder: 200` for product-plugin suggests manual ordering without clear dependency strategy
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement automatic dependency resolution based on manifest `dependencies` array

- [ ] **Add missing cross-plugin service validation in product plugin**
  - **Rationale:** Product plugin references user-auth guard from user-plugin but lacks proper service dependency declaration
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add `crossPluginServices` dependency in `plugins/product-plugin/plugin.manifest.json`

- [ ] **Implement proper error boundaries for plugin context operations**
  - **Rationale:** Plugin context operations in `product-plugin.service.ts:31-55` use basic try/catch without proper recovery strategies
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement circuit breaker pattern for plugin context operations with fallback mechanisms

## Apps

- [ ] **Remove deprecated plugin loader wrapper in `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-loader.service.ts`**
  - **Rationale:** Deprecated wrapper creates confusion and maintenance overhead while serving no functional purpose
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Direct all imports to use `plugin-loader-primary.service.ts` and remove the wrapper entirely

- [ ] **Optimize plugin registry service error handling in `apps/plugin-registry/src/app/services/plugin-registry.service.ts:36-45`**
  - **Rationale:** Generic error conversion to `PluginError` loses important contextual information for debugging
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement specialized error types with preserved stack traces and contextual metadata

- [ ] **Implement proper connection pooling in plugin registry database operations**
  - **Rationale:** No evidence of connection pooling configuration in registry app, potential for connection leaks under load
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Configure TypeORM connection pooling with appropriate limits in database configuration

- [ ] **Add health check endpoints validation in plugin host controllers**
  - **Rationale:** Health controller lacks validation of dependent services (registry connectivity, database health)
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement comprehensive health checks that validate all critical service dependencies

- [ ] **Refactor plugin loading strategy factory pattern in `apps/plugin-host/src/app/strategies/`**
  - **Rationale:** Strategy pattern implementation lacks proper strategy selection criteria and performance monitoring
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add strategy performance metrics and automatic strategy optimization based on load patterns

## Tools

- [ ] **Enhance plugin generator with dependency validation in `tools/plugin/src/generators/plugin.ts:12-50`**
  - **Rationale:** Generator creates plugins without validating dependency compatibility or version constraints
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add dependency resolution check during generation and suggest compatible versions

- [ ] **Improve plugin build executor error reporting in `tools/plugin/src/executors/plugin-build.ts:28-52`**
  - **Rationale:** Build errors only show generic messages without specific file locations or fix suggestions
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Enhance error reporting with file-specific errors, line numbers, and actionable fix suggestions

- [ ] **Add plugin validation caching to reduce build times**
  - **Rationale:** Plugin validation runs on every build without leveraging manifest checksums for unchanged plugins
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement manifest-based validation caching with checksum comparison

- [ ] **Implement plugin template versioning in `tools/plugin/src/generators/files/`**
  - **Rationale:** Plugin templates are static without version tracking, making template updates difficult to manage
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add template versioning with migration scripts for existing plugins

- [ ] **Add plugin dependency analysis tool**
  - **Rationale:** No tooling exists to analyze plugin dependency graphs or detect circular dependencies
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Create new executor that generates dependency graphs and validates plugin relationships

## Libs

- [x] **Consolidate duplicate plugin context interfaces in `libs/plugin-context/src/lib/plugin-context.service.ts:7-70`**
  - **Rationale:** Multiple similar plugin context interfaces create maintenance overhead and API confusion
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Create single comprehensive interface with optional fields and type guards for specific use cases
  - **Completed:** Refactored plugin context interfaces into a hierarchical structure with BasePluginContext, PluginContext, and ExtendedPluginContext. All optional method interfaces now use optional properties for flexibility.


- [x] **Optimize plugin validation library performance in `libs/plugin-validation/`**
  - **Rationale:** Validation services lack caching strategies for repeated validations of unchanged plugins
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement comprehensive validation result caching with manifest checksum keys
  - **Completed:** Enhanced cached validator with intelligent LRU eviction, memory usage tracking, access count monitoring, and improved cache cleanup. Added memory limits (50MB) with automatic eviction of least-used entries.

- [x] **Add type safety to plugin core interfaces in `libs/plugin-core/src/lib/interfaces/`**
  - **Rationale:** Many interfaces use `any` types reducing type safety and development experience
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Replace `any` types with proper generic constraints and union types
  - **Completed:** Replaced all `any` types with proper TypeScript types: `unknown` for flexible values, `Record<string, unknown>` for objects, proper generic constraints, and added type guards where needed. Enhanced type safety across plugin interfaces, events, errors, and configuration.

- [x] **Implement proper semantic versioning in `libs/` package.json files**
  - **Rationale:** All libs use version `0.0.1` without proper versioning strategy for breaking changes
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement semantic versioning with automated version bumping based on change types
  - **Completed:** Updated all library versions to proper semantic versioning: shared libraries to 1.0.0, enhanced libraries (plugin-core, plugin-context, plugin-validation) to 1.1.0 based on improvements made. Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md with versioning strategy and dependency management guidelines.

- [x] **Add lib dependency analysis to prevent circular dependencies**
  - **Rationale:** No mechanism exists to detect circular dependencies between libs during build
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add build-time circular dependency detection with clear error reporting
  - **Completed:** Created comprehensive dependency analyzer tool (`tools/dependency-analyzer.js`) that detects circular dependencies, version mismatches, and provides architectural recommendations. Added npm scripts (`deps:analyze`, `deps:check`, `deps:export`) for easy usage. Fixed all version mismatches found during initial analysis.

## Docs

- [ ] **Remove duplicate development patterns documentation**
  - **Rationale:** Both `docs/development-patterns.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATTERNS.md` exist, causing confusion
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Consolidate into single lowercase filename following project conventions

- [ ] **Update plugin loading sequence documentation in `docs/plugin-architecture.md`**
  - **Rationale:** Documentation references 5-phase loading but current implementation uses 6-state state machine
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Update documentation to match current state machine implementation with proper state diagrams

- [ ] **Add missing API documentation for plugin registry endpoints**
  - **Rationale:** No comprehensive API documentation exists for plugin registry service endpoints
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Generate OpenAPI documentation from controller decorators and add to docs folder

- [ ] **Create plugin troubleshooting guide with common error scenarios**
  - **Rationale:** `docs/troubleshooting.md` lacks plugin-specific common issues and resolution steps
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add section covering plugin loading failures, dependency resolution issues, and debugging strategies

- [ ] **Update performance benchmarks with current measurements**
  - **Rationale:** Documentation contains outdated performance figures that don't match current architecture
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Re-run performance benchmarks and update documentation with current metrics

## CLAUDE.md

- [ ] **Clarify plugin dependency injection strategy examples in lines 58-136**
  - **Rationale:** Multiple DI strategies are presented without clear guidance on when to use each approach
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add decision matrix and concrete examples showing appropriate strategy selection

- [ ] **Update environment variable reference with missing variables**
  - **Rationale:** Several environment variables used in code are not documented in CLAUDE.md configuration section
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Audit all environment variable usage across codebase and ensure complete documentation

- [ ] **Add enforcement mechanisms for coding standards**
  - **Rationale:** Detailed coding standards exist but no automated enforcement through pre-commit hooks or CI
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement ESLint rules for plugin-specific patterns and add pre-commit hook configuration

- [ ] **Correct plugin registry port discrepancy**
  - **Rationale:** CLAUDE.md states registry runs on port 6001 but some examples show port 3001
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Standardize on port 6001 throughout all documentation and configuration examples

- [ ] **Add plugin versioning and compatibility guidelines**
  - **Rationale:** No clear guidelines exist for plugin version compatibility and upgrade strategies
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add section covering semantic versioning for plugins, compatibility matrices, and upgrade procedures

- [ ] **Update command examples to match current project structure**
  - **Rationale:** Some CLI examples reference outdated paths or missing commands
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Validate all command examples against current project configuration and update accordingly
