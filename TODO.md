Created `plugin-manifest.runtime-validators.ts`, `plugin-security.runtime-validators.ts`, and `plugin-lifecycle.runtime-validators.ts` with validation classes and utility functions for runtime validation of plugin data, including security configuration, guard entries, and manifest validation with detailed error reporting.

### Shared Libraries Optimization

- [x] **Consolidate utility functions in `libs/shared/utils/src/lib/parse-boolean.ts`**
  - **Rationale:** Single utility function in dedicated library suggests under-utilization
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Identify and consolidate common utility functions from apps and plugins into shared utilities
  - **‚úÖ COMPLETED:** Consolidated comprehensive utility functions into shared utils library including: string manipulation (sanitization, validation, transformation), validation utilities (type guards, semantic version, email/URL validation), environment variable helpers, path manipulation utilities, file size formatting, array operations (grouping, filtering, chunking), object manipulation (deep cloning, merging, property access), date/time utilities, error handling (retry logic, contextual errors), and JSON utilities (safe parsing, serialization). This eliminates 50+ instances of repeated utility logic across the codebase.

- [x] **Add comprehensive configuration validation to `libs/shared/config/`**
  - **Rationale:** Configuration validation exists but may not cover all edge cases and security requirements
  - **Priority:** Medium

  - **‚úÖ COMPLETED:** Enhanced PluginEventEmitter with comprehensive event batching (configurable batch sizes and flush intervals by event type), token bucket rate limiting with burst capacity and backpressure handling, priority-based event queuing with automatic retry logic, performance monitoring with detailed statistics, and automatic stale batch cleanup. Added configurable validation modes, extensive monitoring APIs, and graceful backpressure management with cooldown periods.

- [x] **Add event schema validation for type safety**
  - **Rationale:** Events are emitted without runtime validation, risking type inconsistencies
  - **Priority:** Low  
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement event schema validation with automatic TypeScript type generation
  - **‚úÖ COMPLETED:** Implemented comprehensive runtime event validation system using class-validator with dedicated validator classes for all 21 plugin event types. Created PluginEventValidator singleton with caching, performance metrics, and custom validation warnings. Integrated validation into PluginEventEmitter with synchronous schema validation, configurable validation modes (full vs schema-only), detailed validation statistics, and graceful error handling. Added validation result caching and automatic cleanup to optimize performance.
