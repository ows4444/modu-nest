# TODO Checklist

This comprehensive checklist identifies actionable items to improve the plugin architecture framework across all core areas: Plugins, Apps, Tools, Libs, Docs, and CLAUDE.md.

## Plugins

### Architecture & Performance

- [x] **Reduce plugin manifest coupling in product-plugin** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:7, plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:91-98`
  - **Rationale:** Hard dependency on user-plugin creates tight coupling and makes product-plugin non-reusable in other contexts
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Abstract user authentication through a configurable interface rather than depending directly on user-plugin. Consider using plugin context services for user validation.
  - **Resolution:** Created authentication abstraction interface `IAuthenticationService` with configurable implementation. Removed direct dependency on user-plugin from manifest. Updated guards to use dependency injection with fallback behavior. Created generic `AuthGuard` to replace hard-coded `user-auth` dependencies.

- [x] **Implement proper error handling in plugin controllers** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:112, plugins/user-plugin/src/lib/controllers/user-plugin.controller.ts:66`
  - **Rationale:** Delete operations don't return proper error responses; missing try-catch blocks in several methods
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add comprehensive try-catch error handling and return meaningful error responses with proper HTTP status codes.
  - **Resolution:** Created `ErrorHandler` utility class with standardized error handling patterns. Added comprehensive try-catch blocks to all CRUD operations in both controllers. Implemented proper HTTP status codes and consistent error response format. Added input validation and meaningful error messages.

- [x] **Optimize plugin guard dependencies resolution** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:35, plugins/user-plugin/plugin.manifest.json:44`
  - **Rationale:** Complex guard dependency chains may cause circular dependencies and slow plugin loading
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement guard dependency graph analysis and optimize loading order. Consider using guard composition patterns.
  - **Resolution:** Created `PluginGuardDependencyOptimizer` with comprehensive dependency analysis, circular dependency detection, and optimization algorithms. Enhanced `PluginGuardManager` with optimization methods and performance metrics. Implemented topological sorting, parallel batching, and guard composition suggestions.

### Business Logic

- [x] **Complete cross-plugin service implementations** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/user-plugin/src/lib/controllers/user-plugin.controller.ts:110-122, plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:166-172`
  - **Rationale:** Cross-plugin integration endpoints are incomplete stubs without actual cross-plugin communication
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement proper cross-plugin service communication using the CrossPluginServiceManager with proper service tokens.
  - **Resolution:** Created `ICrossPluginService` interface for standardized cross-plugin communication. Updated both controllers with proper service injection and communication logic. Implemented user-product integration with error handling, data enrichment, and ownership validation through cross-plugin service calls.

- [x] **Add plugin lifecycle hook implementations** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `plugins/product-plugin/src/lib/controllers/product-plugin.controller.ts:24-53, plugins/user-plugin/src/lib/controllers/user-plugin.controller.ts`
  - **Rationale:** User plugin lacks lifecycle hooks while product plugin has them; inconsistent plugin behavior management
  - **Priority:** Low
  - **Suggested Fix:** Standardize lifecycle hooks across all plugins and implement proper cleanup in beforeUnload hooks.
  - **Resolution:** Added comprehensive lifecycle hooks to user plugin controller matching product plugin pattern. Standardized hook implementations with proper logging, status reporting, and cleanup logic. Both plugins now have consistent lifecycle management with beforeLoad, afterLoad, beforeUnload, afterUnload, and onError hooks.

## Apps

### Plugin Host Performance

- [x] **Optimize plugin loader memory usage** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-loader.service.ts:100`
  - **Rationale:** Large plugin loader service with 35K+ lines may cause memory issues; potential memory leaks in plugin tracking
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Implement plugin loader service chunking, use WeakMap for plugin references, and add memory cleanup intervals.
  - **Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive memory optimization with periodic cleanup timer, chunked memory cleanup, enhanced FinalizationRegistry tracking, lightweight cleanup methods, memory pressure monitoring, and comprehensive memory statistics. Added configurable memory pressure thresholds and automatic cleanup intervals to prevent memory leaks.

- [x] **Implement plugin dependency resolver timeout handling** ✅ COMPLETED

Added real-time monitoring with 30-second intervals, automatic cleanup, export capabilities, and admin-protected metrics endpoints. Integrated metrics tracking throughout all registry operations including uploads, downloads, searches, and validation processes.

### Business Architecture Gaps

- [x] **Implement plugin rollback mechanism in host** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/plugin-loader.service.ts`
  - **Rationale:** No rollback capability when plugin updates fail; could leave system in inconsistent state
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add plugin version rollback with state snapshots and dependency rollback cascading.
  - **Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive plugin rollback service with snapshot management, 3 rollback strategies (version, snapshot, dependency-graph), automatic snapshot creation on plugin operations, rollback planning with impact analysis, rollback history tracking, and automatic recovery mechanisms. Added 12 new rollback API methods to PluginLoaderService with support for cascade rollbacks and dry-run capabilities.

- [x] **Add plugin conflict detection and resolution** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `apps/plugin-host/src/app/cross-plugin-service-manager.ts`

## Libs

### Code Quality & Reusability

- [x] **Remove duplicate validation logic between plugin-types and shared/utils** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **File/Module Path:** `libs/plugin-types/src/lib/plugin-interfaces.ts:19-25, libs/shared/utils/src/lib/string-utils.ts:86-88`
  - **Rationale:** Plugin name validation is duplicated in multiple places; violates DRY principle
  - **Priority:** Medium
  - **Suggested Fix:** Consolidate validation logic in shared/utils and export from plugin-types to maintain single source of truth.
  - **Resolution:** Consolidated all plugin validation functions (`isValidPluginName`, `isValidPluginVersion`, `isValidChecksum`, `isValidServiceToken`, `isValidPluginFile`) into `validation-utils.ts` as the single source of truth. Updated plugin-types to import from shared utils rather than duplicating logic. Removed duplicate function from string-utils.ts. This eliminates code duplication and ensures consistent validation behavior across the entire codebase.
