## Version Strategy

### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

#### Major Version (X.0.0)
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Removal of deprecated features
- Significant architectural changes

#### Minor Version (0.X.0)
- New features that are backward compatible
- Deprecation of features (with backward compatibility)
- Internal improvements that may affect behavior

#### Patch Version (0.0.X)
- Bug fixes that are backward compatible
- Security patches
- Documentation updates

### Dependency Management

Libraries follow these dependency patterns:

1. **Core Libraries** (`shared-*`): Independent, minimal dependencies
2. **Plugin Core** (`plugin-core`): Depends on shared utilities
3. **Plugin Specific** (`plugin-*`): Depend on plugin-core and relevant shared libraries
4. **Application Libraries**: Depend on appropriate plugin and shared libraries

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are clearly documented and include:
- Migration guides for affected APIs
- Deprecation notices with timeline
- Alternative approaches for replaced functionality

### Release Process

1. **Development**: Features developed on feature branches
2. **Version Bump**: Semantic versioning applied before release
3. **Changelog**: Updated with all changes
4. **Dependencies**: Cross-library dependencies updated accordingly
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before version tagging
6. **Release**: Tagged releases with detailed release notes
