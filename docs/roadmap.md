- Code coverage minimum: 80% (unit), 60% (integration)
- TypeScript strict mode with minimal `any` types
- API response time: <500ms (95th percentile)
- Memory usage: <1GB steady state with 100+ plugins
- Database query time: <100ms average

## Enhancement Opportunities

### üî¥ Critical Priority (Required for Production Scale)

#### 1. Authentication System
**Current Status:** Not implemented - Framework focuses on plugin architecture rather than authentication

**Note:** The current implementation provides sophisticated plugin loading, dependency resolution, and guard systems without authentication requirements. This is appropriate for development environments and prototype deployments where security is managed at the infrastructure level.

**For Production Use:** Authentication should be implemented based on specific deployment requirements:
- Basic API key authentication for simple deployments
- JWT/OAuth integration for enterprise environments
- Infrastructure-level authentication (reverse proxy, API gateway)
- Custom authentication adapters for specific use cases

#### 2. Database Architecture - SQLite Implementation
**Current Status:** SQLite-based database service - Well-suited for development and moderate scale

**Current Implementation:**
- SQLite database with efficient schema design
- ~50ms average query performance
- Supports 1,000-5,000 plugins effectively
- File-based storage with simple backup/restore
- Perfect for single-instance deployments

**SQLite Advantages:**
- Zero configuration and maintenance
- ACID compliance with excellent reliability
- Fast read operations for plugin metadata
- Embedded database with no external dependencies
- Ideal for development, testing, and small-to-medium deployments

**Scale Considerations:**
- Current SQLite implementation handles expected load effectively
- For larger scale (10K+ plugins), PostgreSQL migration would be beneficial
- Database abstraction layer allows easy migration when needed

#### 3. Plugin Loading Architecture - Current Implementation
